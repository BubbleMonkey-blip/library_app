# library_app
A simple web app for storing books in your library. Use the button in the right hand corner to add a new card for a book in your library. Currently, the app does not have a storage system built in, but this may be added later via local storage or firebase.

The javascript code is organized using object constructor function. This app was built as I worked through the Odin Project curriculum and learning about methods of organizing your javascript code.
